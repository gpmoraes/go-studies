# Go-studies

This is a collection of exercises and code snippets that I have created while learning Go. It includes a variety of topics and concepts that I have studied, such as data types, control structures, functions, packages, and more.

## Contents

- **Exercises**: This folder contains a series of exercises that I have completed to practice various concepts in Go. These exercises include simple programs that demonstrate the use of different data types, control structures, and functions.
- **Greeting**: This folder contains a simple program that greets the user using the Go language. It illustrates the use of functions and packages, and it's a good starting point for new Go developers.

## How to use

1. Make sure you have Go installed on your machine
2. Clone the repository to your local machine
3. Navigate to the project folder using the command line
4. Run the command `go run <file>.go` for each file you want to run
5. The application will run and you will be able to see the output

## Tips
- Each file is self-contained and can be run on its own.
- The exercises and samples in this repository are intended to be used as learning resources and may not be production-ready.
- Feel free to make changes to the code and experiment with different variations to better understand the concepts
